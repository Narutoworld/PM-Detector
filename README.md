# PM-Detector
IOS application to detect PM concentration with image analysis

What I have uploaded here:
  * the source file about the APP
    * Include: function of views, models and controller
    * Include: the app image asset
    * Include: the bridge to C++ file
 * No include:
  * External libarary
    * The cocoapods module: Paparazo
    * The OpenCV library
    
 Note: It seems that the Xcode will include Xcode with symlinks, it should be added when for each individual computer.
 * I guess is there exists tools like CMake which handle the distribution issues for the Xcode project. But I am not aware of it so far.
